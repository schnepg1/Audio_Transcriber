// This file can be used to define shared TypeScript types and interfaces.
// For example, if you had complex API response structures or shared data models.

// Example:
// export interface CustomError {
//   message: string;
//   code?: number;
// }

// Currently, this application uses simple types or types inferred
// from libraries, so this file is minimal.
// It's good practice to have it for future expansion.

export {}; // Ensures this file is treated as a module.
